I'll use this repo to store the code I write while going through the textbook Modern C (2019) by Jens Gustedt.

I like the idea of being able to write programmes which take full advantage of computer hardware and I also
think this will be good practice for the Computing Systems specialisation in Georgia Tech's Online MsCS (if
I get accepted).

TODO:
- [x] Learn how to link multiple c files (*.o files?) together instead of creating a lib directory lol.
  - Just pass multiple source files as arguments to the compiler \*facepalm\*
